## Description 
This application uses NodeJS from the command line to generate a README.md file for a web application uploaded to Github. It prompts the user with questions on how to get the project running, what dependencies are needed, usage instructions, any collaborators or third-party companies that contributed, whether or not there is a copyright or license registered with it, guidelines for how someone can contribute to it, and user tests that can verify the project is free from bugs. All formatting including ordered lists, bulleted lists, links, and images will all be converted to the markdown syntax to be displayed in Github.
